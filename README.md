#### :label:Tech Stack Used
Python3, NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib libraries 

## Problem Statement
- Find data and implement classification algorithms (more algorithms you try, the better). 
-  Remove ‘Y’ column form your classification data, and implement k-mean clustering algorithm on any two columns of the data. Make sure you plot the points before and after clustering. 


## Dataset
Pistachio Dataset; 2 Class - Kirmizi and Siirt Pistachio, 16 and 28 Features

## Code
### Part 1
I’ve used a dataset that contains different features of 2 different species of pistachios for the classification model. The different  classification algorithms used:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classification
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Linear Support Vector Machine

Run [`Pistachio.ipynb`](https://github.com/manisha-nair28/Pistachio-Species-Classification/blob/main/Pistachio.ipynb)  script.

### Part 2
I've used two columns "perimeter " and "roundness" to implement the k means clustering algorithm.
Run [`Pistachio_Clustering.ipynb`](https://github.com/manisha-nair28/Pistachio-Species-Classification/blob/main/Pistachio_Clustering.ipynb) script.
